## Developing

### Built With

TODO: List main libraries, frameworks used including versions (React, Angular etc...)

### Prerequisites

TODO: What is needed to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies or any other tools. include download links.

### Setting up Dev

TODO: Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone repo-here
cd your-project/
npm install
```

And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here.

### Building

TODO: If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here. for example:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

### Deploying / Publishing

TODO: give instructions on how to build and release a new version
In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy your-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

### Testing

TODO: Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
Explain what these tests test and why.

```shell
Give an example
```

### Style guide

TODO: Explain your code style and show how to check it.

### Commiting

TODO: Explain how commiting works with conventional commits
