## What Is This?

This package aims to extend the power of npm scripts in modern javascript projects by providing an abstraction layer to modern project configuration, while providing everything a developer would need to scaffold configs like webpack, babel, jest, and more with sane configuration defaults. In case these defaults just aren't the right fit for your project, this project can also be extended as needed to still provide a starting point for your project configuration
