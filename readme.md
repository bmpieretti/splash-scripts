## What Is This?

This package aims to extend the power of npm scripts in modern javascript projects by providing an abstraction layer to modern project configuration, while providing everything a developer would need to scaffold configs like webpack, babel, jest, and more with sane configuration defaults. In case these defaults just aren't the right fit for your project, this project also aims to help scaffold those configs and provide an extensible system to override the base configurations.

# Getting Started

TODO: Basic usage from an npm script, npx, or how to eject from the abstraction layer and generate configs

[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/water.png)](#usage)

## Usage


### Configurations
TODO: Examples on overriding, script calling, extending, using the config file in general

### API Reference
TODO: Total API ref, this should be autogenerated from the code

[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/water.png)](#versioning)

## Versioning

TODO: We can maybe use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [link to tags on this repository](/tags).

## Developing

### Built With

TODO: List main libraries, frameworks used including versions (React, Angular etc...)

### Prerequisites

TODO: What is needed to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies or any other tools. include download links.

### Setting up Dev

TODO: Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone repo-here
cd your-project/
npm install
```

And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here.

### Building

TODO: If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here. for example:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

### Deploying / Publishing

TODO: give instructions on how to build and release a new version
In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy your-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

### Testing

TODO: Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
Explain what these tests test and why.

```shell
Give an example
```

### Style guide

TODO: Explain your code style and show how to check it.

### Commiting

TODO: Explain how commiting works with conventional commits
